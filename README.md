# Welcome to My Codespace!

This github hosts my personal webpage files and tools — with special support from **Lovable** in the creation of the initial framework. I've updated this website to better fit my personal brand, goals, and career. I imagine this will shift over time again and again as I grow as a person, but for now, enjoy!

## About the Project

This site was created as an expression of my creative and professional identity. It includes:

- A thoughtfully designed homepage
- Scroll-based navigation
- Custom animation and transitions
- Sections for my work, background, and contact
- Mobile-first responsive design

Lovable played a key role in shaping the content, layout, and tone of the site. I chose Lovable as an experiment. As a data scientist and creative, Lovable is an interesting research study. I've often heard it being quoted as a "replacement for all web-designers". Naturally, I was concerned, and curious as to what could be so powerful about the tool. After testing it with my personal website, I have many thoughts that all boil down to: No, this is not a web designer or full-stack developer replacement. In fact, it is no where CLOSE to taking anyone's job. 

What Lovable is really good at, however, is prototyping and frameworking ideas. It simplifies and quickens the pace at which you can visualise ideas, bounce off templates, and create something you really love. Lovable is not an out of the box solution, but it's kind of like a box of legos. It provides you with the pieces you need, and you, as the developer, can pick and choose those features, edit them, or even replace them as you see fit. 

For this type of developing, Lovable is fantastic, and I'm excited to have gotten a chance to test it for this project. Will I continue using it to prototype other ideas? Possibly. Will it take over my friend's jobs that are designers and developers? Not anytime soon. Lovable is a great product, but it requires great artists to turn it into something truly magical.
