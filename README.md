Here is my personal website hosted through github. This website was originally created as a part of the Data Science for the Creative Industries course at UAL's Creative Computing Institute. Below are the instructions followed to create this website:

* Create a new repository using this template and rename it to [yourusername].github.io, then clone it to your machine. 
* Fill in information about yourself in index.html, change the links to your social media accounts in menu.html and change the picture and CV files to you profile picture and your pdf CV. 
* Commit and push the changes to your github repo. Then follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) for setting up your github pages website!

This template was adapted from this great simple HTML project website template https://github.com/yenchiah/project-website-template, originally created by: http://yenchiah.me/

Following the completion of this degree, this website was completely revamped using HTML and CSS to translate it from the template provided above, to a unique and self-designed website showcasing my professional accomplishments and personal style.
