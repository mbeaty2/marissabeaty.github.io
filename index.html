              <p class="project-details">
                There are some 5,500 confirmed Exoplanets beyond our solar system. Though we know these planets exist, most of them are too far away for us to know what they look like. In this project, I developed an algorithm and a model to translate any given exoplanet’s numeric data into a text prompt that can be input into a trained latent diffusion model to generate a predictive visualization of that exoplanet. This research describes a novel approach of translating numeric data to textual descriptors formulated from prior accepted astrophysical research. These textual descriptions are paired with photographs and artistic visualizations from NASA’s public archives to build a training set for a latent diffusion model, which can produce new visualizations of unseen distant worlds.

                Content Based Generation: Bridging the Gap Between Books and Music with Literary Song Recommendations</h3>
              <p class="project-details">
                This project aimed to develop a recommendation system that suggests songs based on the content of a book. By using Spotify's API, four essential song features were adapted to the text: Speechiness, Instrumentalness, Valence, and Energy. Speechiness, representing the wordiness in the text, was determined through the ratio of stop words to total words. Instrumentalness, which proved challenging to define for a book, was calculated by comparing the book's word count to the average word count for various book types. Valence, reflecting the book's sentiment, was assessed using a pre-trained sentiment analysis tool. Energy, a more complex feature, was approximated by comparing word vectors of the book's genres. The results demonstrated the feasibility of linking literature and music and underscored the role of preconceived notions in the interpretation of book-to-song associations, offering room for future refinements and additional features.

              <p class="project-details">
                In this project assignment, the objective was to analyze a dataset containing a list of the Top 100 most streamed songs on Spotify, focusing on three numeric variables: beats per minute (BPS), danceability, and valence. The study aimed to explore the relationships between these variables through various regression models. The project began with an initial data exploration, including examining the data's summary statistics and identifying any potential outliers. Subsequently, the project proceeded to assess the relationships between BPS and danceability, and later incorporated valence to investigate its correlation with both BPS and danceability. A Linear Regression model was employed to predict valence based on BPS and danceability, using data from the dataset.
